# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This is a good example to illustrate the importance of careful array index handling and bounds checking in Java.  The bug is simple, but it is a frequent source of runtime errors in many applications.
